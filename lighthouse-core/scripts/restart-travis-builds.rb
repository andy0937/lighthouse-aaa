# @fileoverview This script restarts travis builds that have either:
#   1) timed out due to flakiness
#   2) failed due to no screenshots collected in the trace.
# It looks for builds from the past 3 days, and within each build it finds the job(s) that failed
# or timed out, and restarts 'em.

# step 1. generate github token and and use in .netrc
#   https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/
#   Leave all scope checkboxes unchecked.
#   Place in your ~/.netrc file like so:
#     machine github.com login <token>

# step 2. install travis ruby library: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb/
#   gem install travis
#   travis login --auto

# step 3. run this script.
#   ruby lighthouse-core/scripts/restart-travis-builds.rb
# To run it every 2 minutes...
#   while true; ruby lighthouse-core/scripts/restart-travis-builds.rb; sleep 120s; end;

# optional step 4. you might also want to keep an eye on all starts, failures, and passes:
#   travis monitor
